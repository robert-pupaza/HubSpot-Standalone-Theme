# HubSpot-Standalone-Theme
## This is a HubSpot Theme customised for easy module development with less restrictions.

The Highlight of this theme is the nonDND.module, it's a powerful module that gives flexibility to almost everything you need. Is a repeater for sections with settings that range from background types to column withs.

The overwrite section is used to add extra modules/css/js that will overwrite the original one without the change effecting the integral part of the theme.

CSS: I am using a custom grid system build by me based on the bootstrap idea. stripped down to only the neccecery code.



# How to Use:

1. Upload it to your portal.
2. Set up the Theme settings.
3. Build your pages using only one module (nonDND).
